:::warning
The API for consuming data from the Evolve data server is currently in alpha and very likely to experience breaking changes 
in the future. Please provide any feedback about this API to [Zepben](www.zepben.com).
:::

The SDK provides a client to request models to a remote data server via [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). The service and proto 
definitions for this API can be found [here](https://github.com/zepben/evolve-grpc). An implementation of the consumer 
server is provided with the Evolve platform data services.

When working with models, it is often impractical to load a whole model to a client due to the size of the data. This 
is generally not a problem however, as most use cases only operate on a small subsection of the model at a time. So, the 
consumer API provides the ability to request smaller portions of the model quickly and easily. The other benefit to this
is you can set up many clients in parallel operating on different chunks of the model to reduce the amount of time to
run any analytics you may wish to perform across the whole model.

## Connecting to a server

```python
from zepben.cimbend.streaming import connect, connect_async
# Synchronous
with connect(host="localhost", rpc_port=50051) as conn:
    # ... do stuff with conn ...
# Asyncio
with connect_async(host="localhost", rpc_port=50051) as conn:
    # ... do stuff with conn ...
```

## Network Hierarchy

The network can be built with a hierarchy as discussed earlier [here](datamodel.mdx#network-hierarchy). This allows you
to easily identify and request smaller chunks of the network so you can focus on areas of concern. Here is an example
of how to request the network hierarchy and print it out as a tree to the console.

```python

fun printNetworkHierarchy(client: NetworkConsumerClient) {
    val hierarchy: NetworkHierarchy = client.getNetworkHierarchy().result ?: return
    hierarchy.geographicalRegions.values.forEach { region ->
        println("- ${region.name} [${region.mRID}]")
        region.subGeographicalRegions.values.forEach { subRegion ->
            println("  |- ${subRegion.name} [${subRegion.mRID}]")
            subRegion.substations.values.forEach { substation ->
                println("    |- ${substation.name} [${substation.mRID}]")
                substation.feeders.values.forEach { feeder ->
                    println("      |- ${feeder.name} [${feeder.mRID}]")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Each item from the hierarchy result contains an identified object MRID and it's name. This simplified data structure
enables you to do things like easily build a suitable UI component allowing a user to select a portion of the network
they wish to use, without needing to pull back large amount of full object data.

## Requesting Identififed Objects

Identified objects can be requested to build a model client side. When identified objects are loaded, any referenced
objects that have not been previously requested need to be requested explicitly. The exception to this is terminals
are always sent with their conducting equipment and transformer ends are always sent with transformers.

To find the MRIDs of any references that need to be requested you can use the [deferred reference](services.mdx#deferred-references)
functions on the service provided when requesting identified objects.

```python
fun getWithBaseVoltage(service: NetworkService, client: NetworkConsumerClient, mrid: String) {
    val equipment = client.getIdentifiedObject(service, mrid).result
    if (equipment == null || equipment !is ConductingEquipment) {
        return
    }

    service.getUnresolvedReferenceMrids(Resolvers.baseVoltage(equipment)).firstOrNull()
        ?.let { client.getIdentifiedObject(service, it) }
}
```

The Evolve SDK provides the building blocks you need to interface with the rest of the platform. It can also be used to
build your own solutions from scratch that will be compatible with other things built with the SDK.

## CIM Model

The Evolve platform is composed around a domain model based on the 'Common Information Model' (CIM). The CIM is a very
large standard that covers a huge amount of use cases. To make things more digestible, Evolve publishes its own CIM
profile. CIM profiles are subsets of the whole CIM standard that dictates which parts of the model are in use. Evolve
publishes its model at <https://zepben.bitbucket.io/cim/evolve/>.

If the Evolve profile doesn't contain a part of CIM that you require for your use case, you can request or propose a
change to the model following the instructions at: <https://github.com/zepben/evolve-data-model>

## Getting Started With The Model

:::tip
All things that have an ID in the CIM model inherit from
[IdentifiedObject](https://zepben.bitbucket.io/cim/cim100/iec61970/base/core/identifiedobject/). This provides common
attributes such as MRID (master resource identifier), name, description, etc.
:::

Let's get started with the data model by building the following contrived electrical circuit.

![](./assets/contrived-circuit.png)

Here we simply have an AC energy source ([EnergySource](https://zepben.bitbucket.io/cim/evolve/iec61970/base/wires/energysource/))
connected to a conductor ([ACLineSegment](https://zepben.bitbucket.io/cim/evolve/iec61970/base/wires/aclinesegment/))
connected to a circuit breaker ([Breaker](https://zepben.bitbucket.io/cim/evolve/iec61970/base/wires/breaker/)).
In CIM all these things are a subtype of 
[ConductingEquipment](https://zepben.bitbucket.io/cim/evolve/iec61970/base/core/conductingequipment/).

Let's see how we create them:

```python
// Create the energy source. Providing no ID will generate a UUID.
val source = EnergySource()

// Create the conductor providing a specific ID.
val acLine = AcLineSegment("aclineseg1")

// Create a circuit breaker.
// A UUID will be generated but we can give it a descriptive name.
val breaker = Breaker().apply { name = "my circuit breaker" }
```

## Creating Connectivity

In CIM, all conducting equipment can have any number of [Terminals](https://zepben.bitbucket.io/cim/evolve/iec61970/base/core/terminal/), 
and terminals connect to other terminals using a [ConnectivityNode](https://zepben.bitbucket.io/cim/evolve/iec61970/base/core/connectivitynode/). 
If we redraw the above diagram with all the required items from CIM it would look like:

![](./assets/contrived-circuit-cim.png)

Where the back dots represent the terminals and the black diamonds represent connectivity nodes.

Now, lets redo the above code sample this time also creating connectivity between the objects.

```python
// Create the energy source
val source = EnergySource()

// Create the terminal for the energy source and associate it with the source
val sourceT1 = Terminal().apply { conductingEquipment = source }
source.addTerminal(sourceT1)

// Create the conductor
val acLine = AcLineSegment()

// Create a terminal for each end of the conductor
// and associate them with the conductor
val acLineT1 = Terminal().apply { conductingEquipment = acLine }
val acLineT2 = Terminal().apply { conductingEquipment = acLine }
acLine.addTerminal(acLineT1)
acLine.addTerminal(acLineT2)

// Create a circuit breaker
val breaker = Breaker()

// Create a terminal for the breaker
val breakerT1 = Terminal().apply { conductingEquipment = breaker }

// Now create a connectivity node to connect the source terminal
// to the conductor's first terminal
val cn1 = ConnectivityNode()

// Now associate the connectivity nodes to the terminals
cn1.addTerminal(sourceT1)
sourceT1.connectivityNode = cn1
cn1.addTerminal(acLineT1)
acLineT1.connectivityNode = cn1

// Now create a connectivity node to connect the source terminal
// to the conductor's first terminal
val cn2 = ConnectivityNode()

// Now associate the connectivity nodes to the terminals
cn2.addTerminal(acLineT2)
acLineT2.connectivityNode = cn2
cn2.addTerminal(breakerT1)
breakerT1.connectivityNode = cn2
```

## Normal and Current states

As the network is a dynamic model (that is things like switches can be open and closed) many things in the model support 
the notion of 'normal' and 'current'. For example a switch has a normally open state and a currently open state. 
This allows you to perform analysis on the model considering the normal or current state of the network, and allows you 
to tell if the network is currently in the normal state or not. This can be important when making decisions based on 
analytics you may be running when using the model.

```python
// Example of setting normal and current switch states
val switch = Breaker()
switch.setNormallyOpen(true)
switch.setOpen(false)
```

## Phases 

Phases in CIM are set on a [Terminal](https://zepben.bitbucket.io/cim/evolve/iec61970/base/core/terminal/). The `phases`
property on the terminal should be considered the terminal's 'nominal' phases. The vast mojority of the time, this will
be the actual active phases at that terminal. However, due to the dynamic nature of the network, it's possible that when
tracing connecitvity that the active phase at the terminal is different. The phase can be tracked using the `tracedPhases`
property on the terminal. 

:::tip
There are a number of helpful functions for tracing phases based on connectivity. See [tracing](sdk/tracing.mdx) for more details.
:::

```python
// Example of setting nominal phases on a terminal
Terminal terminal = Terminal().apply { phases = PhaseCode.ABC };
```

## Grouping equipment

In electricity distribution networks, a model is typically made up of groups of equipment that represent different
sections of the network. For example things like: feeder, zone (substation), transmission line etc. The terminology 
differs within the industry, however CIM provides types of 
[EquipmentContainer](https://zepben.bitbucket.io/cim/evolve/iec61970/base/core/equipmentcontainer/) to allow you to
group equipment into the above types of categories. Refer to the Evolve profile CIM profile for all supported equipment 
container types in the model, however the most common ones are:

- [Line](https://zepben.bitbucket.io/cim/evolve/iec61970/base/wires/line/)
- [Substation](https://zepben.bitbucket.io/cim/evolve/iec61970/base/core/substation/)
- [Feeder](https://zepben.bitbucket.io/cim/evolve/iec61970/base/core/feeder/)

### Network Hierarchy

When creating a `Substation` you will see that it can belong to a 
[SubGeographicalRegion](https://zepben.bitbucket.io/cim/evolve/iec61970/base/core/subgeographicalregion/) and a 
`SubGeogrpahicalRegion` can belong to a 
[GeographicalRegion](https://zepben.bitbucket.io/cim/evolve/iec61970/base/core/geographicalregion/). 

When using various parts of the Evolve platform, it will refer to the concept of a network hierarchy. This is the 
mechanism used to chunk up the network and provides an overview of what makes up the model. The network hierarchy looks
as follows:

* GeographicalRegion
  * SubGeographicalRegion
    * Substation
      * Feeder

When working with the Evolve Platform, it is important to make sure equipment and equipment containers are correctly
populated as there are assumptions built around the network being structured in this pattern.

### Feeders

A feeder is generally a chain of equipment from a nominated starting point in a `Substation` to all open points when 
tracing along the equipment. The starting point can be defined by setting a 
[Feeder's]((https://zepben.bitbucket.io/cim/evolve/iec61970/base/core/feeder/)) `normalHeadTerminal`. This means if you
have a correctly connected model, setting the feeder equipment container on any equipment can be calculated dynamically. 
This has the benefit of making sure that an equipment's feeder is always correct (because it has been set by checking
connectivity). A function to do this is provided as part of the [tracing](sdk/tracing.mdx#useful-traces) package. 

### Example

The following example shows how you can build a network hierarchy and assign equipment to their appropriate equipment
containers.

```python
val region = GeographicalRegion()
val subRegion = SubGeographicalRegion().apply {
    geographicalRegion = region
    region.addSubGeographicalRegion(this)
}

val substation = Substation().apply { subGeographicalRegion = subRegion }

val subTx = PowerTransformer().apply {
    addContainer(substation)
    substation.addEquipment(this)
}

val feeder = Feeder().apply { normalEnergizingSubstation = substation }

val feederCb = Breaker().apply {
    addContainer(feeder)
    feeder.addEquipment(this)
}
```
